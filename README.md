Below are some key queries provided in the analysis:

```sql
-- Count the total number of Movies and TV Shows
SELECT 
    type, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_count 
FROM netflix_titles 
GROUP BY type;

-- Find all content released in the year 2020
SELECT * 
FROM netflix_titles 
WHERE release_year = 2020;

-- List all directors who directed at least one Movie
SELECT DISTINCT director 
FROM netflix_titles 
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND director IS NOT NULL;

-- Count the number of content items added each year
SELECT 
    release_year,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content 
FROM netflix_titles 
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY release_year;

-- Find the top 3 most popular ratings
SELECT 
    rating, 
    COUNT(*) AS total_count 
FROM netflix_titles 
GROUP BY rating 
ORDER BY total_count DESC 
LIMIT 3;
```
